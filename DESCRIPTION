Description: This package provides a set of functions to process survey data using metaprogramming. It is designed to work with the survey package, but it can be used with any other package that provides a similar data structure. The main goal of this package is to provide a set of functions that can be used to process survey data in a more efficient way, by using metaprogramming to generate code that can be used to process the data.
